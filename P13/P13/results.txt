max_int for my machine (between 20 and 30 second runtime without threads): I can't quite get to 20-30s run time. 10000000

Without threads: 1m14.847s



With 2 threads: 1m53.550s 1m21.510



With 4 threads: 3m24.561s 1m50.887



With 8 threads: 1m32.337s 0m6.853



With 16 threads: 1m38.337s 0m4.743



With 32 threads: 1m19.191s 0m1.395



With 64 threads: 1m15.893s 0m6.261



QUESTION: After threading is added to threads.cpp, is the order of prime numbers found in primes_threads.txt the same or different than in primes.txt?  Why?
no, because whichever threads find the prime number first get to push that number onto vector

QUESTION: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?
not necessarily. if excess threads are added, it will slow down the program

QUESTION: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
constant
